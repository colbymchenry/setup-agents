## The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but it's a generalist. When you ask it to plan, code, review, test, and QA in one session — context bleeds, focus drifts, and quality suffers.

**Setup Agents** fixes this by generating **purpose-built subagents** that each do one job exceptionally well, scoped to your actual project.

<br>

## What You Get

```
.claude/
├── agents/
│   ├── architect.md    ← Plans before code gets written
│   ├── coder.md        ← Implements following your conventions
│   ├── reviewer.md     ← Reviews with your priorities in mind
│   ├── tester.md       ← Writes & runs tests that matter
│   └── design-qa.md    ← Visual QA via screenshots (web + mobile)
└── hooks/
    ├── git-context.sh    ← Branch-aware git history on session start
    ├── agent-reminder.sh ← Agent nudge on every prompt
    └── verify.sh         ← Runs affected tests before task completion
```

Each agent is a markdown file with its own **system prompt**, **tool restrictions**, **model choice**, and **persistent memory**. The hooks keep Claude on track — injecting project context and reminding it to delegate. Everything is fully editable.

<br>

## How It Works

The skill runs a 4-phase process that takes about 2 minutes:

```
 DETECT          INTERVIEW          GENERATE          VERIFY
┌──────┐        ┌──────────┐       ┌──────────┐      ┌────────┐

 Languages       Review focus       Tailored to       Try it with
 Frameworks      Architecture       YOUR stack        a real task
 Test runners    Conventions        YOUR tools
 Linters         Validation         YOUR patterns
```

<br>

### Phase 1 — Detect

Scans your project and classifies it:

| Type | Validation Strategy |
|:-----|:---|
| **Web** — React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Shopify, etc. | Playwright screenshots + tests |
| **Backend** — APIs, CLI tools, libraries | curl + unit/integration tests |
| **Fullstack** — Both | Playwright for UI, tests for API |
| **Mobile** — iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter | Maestro + simulator screenshots |

<br>

### Phase 2 — Interview

Four focused question batches via interactive prompts — not a wall of text:

> **Review** — What matters most? Security, performance, readability, consistency.
>
> **Architecture** — Feature-based, component-driven, MVC, or follow existing?
>
> **Testing** — Pragmatic, thorough, full coverage, or unit only?
>
> **Conventions** — Conventional Commits, descriptive, or match existing?

<br>

### Phase 3 — Generate

Creates agents that reference **your actual stack** — not generic instructions.

A coder agent for a Next.js + TypeScript project looks completely different from one for a Django + Python project. The generated prompts include your linter config, your test runner, your file patterns, your commit style.

Also updates your `CLAUDE.md` with an Agent Workflow section and optionally installs **session hooks** that keep Claude on track (see below).

<br>

### Phase 4 — Verify

Pick an agent and test it with a real task before you leave the session.

<br>

## Visual Validation

Agents can't see what they're building — unless you give them eyes.

The **design-qa agent** handles visual verification. After the coder finishes, design-qa screenshots affected pages at multiple viewports, reads the images, and audits layout, responsive behavior, typography, and accessibility.

**Web projects** use Playwright screenshots. **Mobile projects** use Maestro + simulator/emulator screenshots (iOS Simulator or Android Emulator).

```
 ┌─────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌────────┐
 │ Coder   │────▶│ Design QA  │────▶│ Inspect  │────▶│ Report │
 │ finishes│     │ screenshots│     │ visually │     │findings│
 └─────────┘     └────────────┘     └──────────┘     └────────┘
```

<br>

## CodeGraph Integration

If [CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) is installed, agents trace the full dependency graph to scope their work:

```bash
# Instead of guessing which files are affected...
git diff --name-only HEAD | codegraph affected --stdin --quiet
```

Changed a utility? CodeGraph finds every test, component, and module that transitively depends on it — even files not in the diff. Without it, agents fall back to `git diff` pattern matching.

<br>

## Session Hooks

Agents only work if Claude actually uses them. Setup Agents solves this with three layers:

| Layer | When | What it does |
|:------|:-----|:-------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Loaded every session | Agent workflow table + delegation instructions |
| **`git-context.sh`** | Session start | Injects branch-aware git history + uncommitted changes |
| **`agent-reminder.sh`** | Every prompt | Reminds Claude of available agents and the delegation workflow |
| **`verify.sh`** | Task completion | Runs affected tests and blocks if they fail |

The `SessionStart` hook gives Claude immediate project awareness — which branch you're on, recent commits, and what's been changed. It's smart about branches:

- **On main/master** — shows the last 5 commits
- **On a feature branch** — shows branch commits since diverging, plus recent main commits
- **Just branched** — shows the parent branch's recent commits

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook dynamically reads your agent files and injects a brief reminder before every message, so Claude never drifts from the delegation workflow mid-session.

The `Stop` hook is the safety net. When Claude finishes a task, `verify.sh` finds every changed file, traces affected tests via CodeGraph (or falls back to file pattern matching), and runs only those tests. If anything fails, Claude is blocked from reporting done until it fixes the failures. This is a shell script, not an agent — it doesn't forget, doesn't drift, and doesn't skip steps.

All hooks are fully editable in `.claude/hooks/`.

<br>

## Usage

```bash
# In any project, just run:
/setup-agents

# After setup, agents work automatically:
# Claude delegates planning to architect, reviews to reviewer, etc.

# Or invoke a specific agent:
@architect plan the authentication flow
@coder implement the login page
@reviewer check my latest changes
@tester write tests for the new API endpoints
```

<br>

## Installation

Copy `SKILL.md` to your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Global (available in all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/setup-agents
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/setup-agents/SKILL.md
```

Or clone this repo directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colbymchenry/setup-agents.git ~/.claude/skills/setup-agents
```
